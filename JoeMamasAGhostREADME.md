- 👋 Hi, I’m @Killerjellyfish
- 👀 I’m interested in 
        coding as a part time thing really just learning what makes a computer/cellphone/internet
        tick. as of yet i havent writen or exicuted any scripts. i really am only comfortable with 
        typing commands that show me everyting that's going on in my systems. a good example of that 
        is that one time i used crosh to hack my gf rumba and made it do circles. just playing around in crosh 
        one day and i could make the rumba go wherever i wanted. really just interested in ethical hacking. 
        or
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
         how coding works in linux, chrome, and windows
         for the most part i am formilar with windows cmd, but its like a car with training wheels compaired to 
         crosh and bash. It could just be that i was raised on windows 95 or even the older version that 
         you had to use a command to launch games with the old green text( i was about 5 when i learned how to
         launch wheel of fourtune with a command) but that was 25 years ago and operating systems are a bit mor complex
         so just trying to learnn how to manipulat the os to what i need and what my network may need.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate 
      on anything to do with coding and learing code. i can read and understand most of it but get cought up in the fine details. 
      Honestly i love code just reading it and how it works facinates me and has become one of my favoite hobbies. I am not quit as keen on scripts yet though
      im still pretty new to it and doing it in my free time. Im really just looking at it as a passion.
